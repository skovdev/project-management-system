# Scenarios

This folder contains high-level behavior scenarios describing
API flows and authorization rules.

These scenarios are not exhaustive API documentation.
They exist to clarify:
- expected user flows
- resource ownership rules
- access control boundaries

Detailed request/response schemas and error handling
are intentionally omitted.
